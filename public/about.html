<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Kartikay Saini. A boy with curious mind from Haryana part of India. Currently, I am doing Computer Science 
  Engineering from <a href="https://www.cuchd.in/">Chandigarh University</a>, Punjab, India.
</p>

<p>As I am very curious to learn new things, so apart from my academic studies I have decided to learn a new skill of "Web Development".
 I am really enjoying this journey of web development and it has taken my creativity to a next level. I will master this skill very soon.
</p>

<p>Aside from all these things, I am also working on my Communication Skills. In future also, I will be engaged in learning new things and lessons from my life as it is well said
  'Learning is a journey not a Destination'.
